# Minimax-algorithm-for-tictactoe
Code outputs the optimal move when given the current state of the board. Works on the principle of MINIMAX.
The runner file creates the game board, which is the interface. It uses pygame.
The runner file then calls the tictactoe file when its the AI'S TURN.
The tictactoe file has various functions to perform certain tasks.
One of them is the minimax function, that should return the optimal move when its given a board.
